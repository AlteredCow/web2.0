  <h3>Rules</h3>
  <p>We are on a hunt for Kaprekar's constant, the number 6174!
    Pick a 4-digit number (1000 - 9999), let's do the magical process!
    Make 2 new numbers by arranging the digits in decreasing and increasing order.
    So 1364 becomes 6431 and 1346 -- and now subtract them.
    Rinse and repeat with the difference!
    If your number is all-repeating, say 1111, you'll hit 0 immediately.
    Otherwise, you will eventually arrive at 6147.
    The fun part: 6147 will *ahem* constantly produce itself.
    So once you've arrived, you're forever captured by this process!
