      Bayes' Thereom is this: <img src="img/entries/bayes_formula.png" alt="P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(B)/P(A)">
      So, what does any of this mean? Why should you care?
      Bayes' Theorem gives us probabilities of 'events' or 'truths.'
       
      
      "A | B" means if A is true, then B is also true.
      "A | B" is false when A is true and B false.
      You might say A being true <em>requires</em> B to be true too.
      For example, A = it is raining and B = I will bring an umbrella.
      So You can determine the probability of this, P(A|B), rather easily.
      
      Some argue that our minds are "Bayesian."
      Meaning, we build models of the world using Bayesian probabilities.
      So then, what we believe is dependent on our experiences.
      For example, if you worked with snakes a lot, you may believe
      that the blown-out bike tire on the trail was a snake too.
      This is becuase your mind said the chances of 
      "long stringy thing" being a snake is the most probable explanation.
      
      Bayes' Theorem is a beautiful tool to determine cause-and-effect relations: 
      How likely you are to get a cold in a given environment.
      How likely you will enjoy some flavor ice cream.
      How likely a pitch will go well depending on past experiences.
      Many many things -- the theorem is found subtly in nature.
