TRIVIAL / EASY
% encapsulate global variables
	* @media, @gridview: 30% to 20% (3 to 2 img in row)
			[ decrease height as well as to reduce img to p spacing]
	* fix content writing
	* fix footer
	* fix @M -- make Aloha-footer-like
	* minimize CSS, e.g. font variance (make more patterns rather than improv)
	* @menu: only text-highlight current page? (leaving expansion for choosing)
	* add JavaDoc
	% switch <classic> tags to more <semantic> ones

SOME LENGTH
	* brand self a logo [banner + tab] >> AT merge design (a flows to T)
	* might shadow-dom some particular inner-topic-webapps [reusability]

DIFFICULT
	* blinking cursor animation: end of austin_tucker
