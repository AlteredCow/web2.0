      "major": "Our wakeful selves are in a constant tension between internal and external worlds.<br>Our brains focuses either on reflective or directive content.<br>Either we examine thoughts and imagery or examine senses and scenery.<br>Have you noticed that you tend to stare away when deep in-thought?<br>Usually, we will find ourselves looking at something blank, such as a wall.<br>Or, if we are \"zoned out,\" we may not even pay attention to what is in front of us.",
      "minor": "Sensory deprivation tanks are amazing for showing this.<br>You lose all your external and are forced into the internal.<br>How comfortable are you gauging completely inwards, left alone with your thoughts?<br>You should give it a try!"

      "major": "There is no such thing as 'cold'.<br>Coldness is not a 'thing' such as water or smell. It is a lack of thing.<br>Temperature is a measure of average molecular activity.<br>So, coldness is a lack of heat, just as darkness is a lack of light.",
      "minor":
            "Humans are great at 'making things from nothing'.<br>Our brains are costantly searching for meaning in the world.<br>We often find meaning by 'thingness'.<br>Look at all the objects that we give a more lively character to.<br>We call our prized possessions our babies and see faces in the clouds.<br>So, we are always interpreting -- all the time, every minute.<br>Let's be careful though, because we may easily fool ourselves.<br>Is that person truly angry at us? Was that event truly a miracle?<br>Or are we misinterpreting?<br>Also, bark at your roommates or your parents: you <em>never</em> 'let the cold in.'"

      "minor": "Of course we orient maps to convention -- specifically to Earth's poles.<br>So what then?<br>The maps are only an example of my point:<br>We go through life accepting defaults as what is 'right'.<br>Maps, serving sizes, what is fashionable, what makes a successful life.<br>Convention makes life easier. Do we keep questioning when we are spoon-fed beliefs though?"

After all, our psychology relies on our biology, which relies on chemistry, which relies on physics. This means all emotions, beliefs, and personalities are fundamentally physical. All that you love is physical.",
      "minor": "So what?<br>From the laws of physics, we see how the world is determinable.<br>We know that, if we crunch the numbers right, we can launch a soccer ball so many yards.<br>All activity is then a computation for us to discover, all set-in-stone.<br>If that's the case, how much freedom can you and I have?<br>Humans are no more than a soccer ball."
