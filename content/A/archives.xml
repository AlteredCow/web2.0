    <title>Introduction</title>
    <major>
      Welcome to the thought corner of the site!
      It's pretty amazing.
      The hope is that reading will both spark some curosity
      and that you have fun with my thoughts manifesting themselves into text.
      Taken at face-value, a lot of content will appear absurd.
      Yet we know that there is insight into the aburd anyhow.

      Our wakeful selves are in a constant tension between internal and external worlds.
      Our brains focuses either on reflective or directive content.
      Either we examine thoughts and imagery or examine senses and scenery.
      Have you noticed that you tend to stare away when deep in-thought?
      Usuaully, we will find ourselves looking at something blank, such as a wall.
      Or, if we are "zoned out," we may not even pay attention to what is in front of us.

      Sensory deprivation tanks are amazing for showing this.
      You lose all your external and are forced into the internal.
      How comfortable are you gauging completely inwards, left alone with your thoughts?
      You should give it a try!

    <major>
      Look at America.
      We see how more successful cities are ones with easy access to clean water.
      Population and prosperity of cities today rely on past discoveries of these waters.
      NYC, Chicago, Cleveland, the coastal cities...it becomes pretty obvious!
      We also do not see many people in the Great Plains due to the lack of water.

      A country is shaped largely by its shape!
      History is very much geographical!

    <title>Tetris Effect</title>
    <major>
      The phenomenon of the brain altering your experiences based on
      constant exposure to a particular activity.
      It gets its name from the effect coming from playing Tetris extensively.
      Without effort, the subject begins to see the world Tetris-like.
      Blocks become more obvious, and the person overall is ready to play, being in 'Tetris-mode'.

      This is incredible information!

      I ran into this effect after heavily playing <a><em>Borderlands</em></a>
      My visual field became more cel-shaded -- which was both bizarre and awesome!

      There is no such thing as 'cold'.
      Coldness is not a 'thing' such as water or smell. It is a lack of thing.
      Temperature is a measure of average molecular activity.
      So, coldness is a lack of heat, just as darkness is a lack of light.

      Humans are great at 'making things from nothing'.
      Our brains are costantly searching for meaning in the world.
      We often find meaning by 'thingness'.
      Look at all the objects that we give a more lively character to.
      We call our prized possessions our babies and see faces in the clouds.
      So, we are always interpreting -- all the time, every minute.
      Let's be careful though, because we may easily fool ourselves.
      Is that person truly angry at us? Was that event truly a miracle?
      Or are we misinterpreting?
      Also, bark at your roommates or your parents: you <em>never</em> 'let the cold in.'

    <title>Eat Up</title>
    <major>
      Eating is theft.
      When we eat, we steal energy.
      Particularly, we steal energy from a once-living thing.
      Whether that's the sugar, meat, or leaves of life.
      We do not charge ourselves from a outlet or from a gas tank.
      We do get nutrition from eating never-living objects.
      Our fuel is bio-degradable.

      The circle of life is all around us!
      If we want to go further, no life is possible without the sun.
      So, the energy spent reading this was basically solar energy!
      Praise the Sun ☼

    <title>How Attractiv</title>

      Gravitational pull is not only for heavier objects.
      We see this misconception everywhere!
      Not only does everything have a gravitational pull,
      everything pulls everything else!
    </major>
    <minor>
      Granted, we only see this for rather large objects.
      Yet I pull you and you pull me.
      All chairs in a room pull on each other to the smallest degree.
      Gravity -- it's for everything to enjoy!
      Maybe the hippies were right about the oceanic connectedness of the universe.

    <title>Losing my Direction</title>
    <major>
      Maps are equally correct when they are upside-down.
      There is no universal law stating what is proper orientation.
      If you follow the directions correctly, you will not become lost.
    </major>
    <minor>
      Of course we orient maps to convention -- specifically to Earth's poles.
      So what then?
      The maps are only an example of my point:
      We go through life accepting defaults as what is 'right'.
      Maps, serving sizes, what is fashionable, what makes a successful life.
      Convention makes life easier. Do we keep questioning when we are spoon-fed beliefs though?

    <title>It's All Relative</title>
    <major>
      E = mc^2 is not the full equation. It is actually E^2 = (pc^2)^2 + (mc^2)^2.  When an object is said to be at rest, its momenetum is 0 (p = mass*velocity = 0), leaving us with E^2 = (mc^2)^2. Square-root each side, then you arrive at E[rest] = mc^2.

       Einstein’s famous equation is Pythagoras’ Theorem at play.

    <title>Let's Get Physical</title>
    <major>
      Standard physicalism is the belief that everything is reducible to the physical world.
      This includes life. After all, our psychology relies on our biology, which relies on chemistry, which relies on physics. This means all emotions, beliefs, and personalities are fundamentally physical. All that you love is physical.
    </major>
    <minor>
      So what?
      From the laws of physics, we see how the world is determinable.
      We know that, if we crunch the numbers right, we can launch a soccer ball so many yards.
      All activity is then a computation for us to discover, all set-in-stone.
      If that's the case, how much freedom can you and I have?
      Humans are no more than a soccer ball.
